          <p class="text-justify">You make an appointment for an archetypal
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">healing experience</span> which interwaves hug therapy and soft fascination stimulation through air, water, and
            sun. This will reconnect you with the profound harmony of inner and outer nature, by accessing the oldest and
            simplest patterns of life. All sessions are designed to bring you pure, simple empathy, experienced in
            <span
              class="text-info font-weight-bold">natural environments</span> that draw you closer to the very fabric of life, like grass, trees, sun, fresh air
            and waters.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            You may opt for a Monday or Thursday hug session, which are experienced during a stroll by boat, or a Tuesday, Wednesday
            or Friday session, which are offered in parks of your choice, or on the pegged boat. Therapy
            is aimed to carry you on an emotional pilgrimage.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            A discrete captain is driving the boat, while the hug therapy is unfolded in privacy and peace. You decide how long a session
            should be. The standard session takes
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">30 minutes</span>, but you may increase it with time slots of 15 minutes each. However, you need to decide upon
            the time you need for your
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">emotional pilgrimage</span> when you make the appointment. Spontaneous decisions to extend a session may be hindered
            due to other appointments.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The strong connection with the therapist, the instantly effects of hugs which activate inner happiness, along with the
            <span
              class="text-info font-weight-bold">fresh air, solar exposure</span> and the womb-like feeling of the boat or the rooting experience of standing
            on the ground, under trees, they all create a powerful, emotional awakening. Passing the river or resting on
            the grass become a passage ritual to overpass the loneliness, gloom and the slumber from our hearts.

          <h3 class="mb-4 font-weight-bold">What’s in a hug</h3>
          <h5 class="mb-4 font-weight-bold text-info">At first, it was pure empathy</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">There are moments in time when no present in the world could boost the sense of belonging, of being accepted and
            appreciated for what you are. Hugs are designed for that, as they are simple and pure manifestations of empathy.
            They make oxytocin, the hormone of love, to flow and radiate through your whole body, offering you a
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">beyond words experience</span> that restores your emotional balance.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            But as we became more and more confined in our jobs, worries and social norms, we also got uneasy to ask or to offer empathic
            hugs. When someone asks us to hold him or her in our arms, we either offer a short, polite embrace, or we get
            worried that something really unsettling is going on.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            Hug therapy brings you the
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">bodily experience of empathy, non-judgemental and emotional relieving</span>. Those who experienced it felt like
            literally a stone was moved away from their souls. They satisfied a fundamental need, without going through the
            pain inflicted by the intricate process of managing others’ expectations, believes, emotional disponibility or
            reactions.

          <p class="text-justify">Hundreds of years ago, buddhist monks developed the concept of
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">fukinsey</span>, to label a surprising fill-in the gaps game offered by nature. Its patterns allow us to grasp
            the main idea of a natural design, but details are never entirely revealed, so we are driven to create mental
            space for imagination and intuition. That’s how we become
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">co-creators of the environment</span> and
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">meaning-makers</span>. That’s how we get the feeling of being connected which instantly awakes the sense of belonging.
            This is a very special merging experience which only nature can so intensively provide.

          <h3 class="mb-5 font-weight-bold">Why I’m doing it</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">I am one of the persons liberated through hug therapy. Some years ago, I felt all the
            blessings and the challenges this city has in place for those who live on the verge of change. I was longing
            for hug therapy when I didn’t even know such thing exists. I feel now that my mission is to liberate others and
            offer them this doorway to restore their balance in a changing world. As we get more and more disrupted by all
            technological gadgets which became extensions of our bodies, we experience less the
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">connection with our significant ones</span>. This is the short way to loneliness and depression we are all exposed
            to.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            A hug is one of the most direct ways to show someone we care about him or her and let him or her feel it. Our body instantly
            reacts to a hug, by allowing a suit of happiness associated hormones to bath our organism. I do all I can to
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">create an intimate space</span> where my patients feel both protected and free, disconnected from their destructive
            mind-patterns and able to access a different perspective on their lives.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">
            The strong, empathic relation with my patients, the fresh air, the solar exposure and the archetypal experiences of sitting
            on the grass, or of traveling by boat, create an
            <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">emotional awakening experience</span>, which cures the gloom and slumber of the heart.

          <p class="text-justify">
            We play our art in parks or on a boat, under warm sun and clear sky, always near water, for a subtle experiential blend in
