            <p class="text-justify">You make an appointment for an archetypal <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">healing experience</span> which interwaves hug therapy and soft fascination stimulation
            through air, water, and sun. This will reconnect you with the profound harmony of inner and outer nature, by accessing the
            oldest and simplest patterns of life. All sessions are designed to bring you pure, simple empathy, experienced in <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">natural environments</span> that draw you closer to the very fabric of life, like grass, trees, sun, fresh air and waters.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               You may opt for a Monday or Thursday hug session, which are experienced during a stroll by boat, or a Tuesday, Wednesday
              or Friday session, which are offered in parks of your choice, or on the pegged boat. Therapy on Amsterdam canals is aimed
              to carry you on an emotional pilgrimage.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               A discrete captain is driving the boat, while the hug therapy is unfolded in privacy and peace. You decide how long a session
              should be. The standard session takes <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">30 minutes</span>, but you may increase it with time slots of 15 minutes each. However, you
              need to decide upon the time you need for your <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">emotional pilgrimage</span> when you make the appointment. Spontaneous decisions
              to extend a session may be hindered due to other appointments.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               Our patients honor our mission, time, and good hearted deeds through small thank-offerings. - One session of hug therapy
              in a park or on the steady boat: €45/ each extra slot of 15 minutes: €20 - One session of hug therapy while boating: €55/
              each extra slot of 15 minutes: €25
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               The strong connection with the therapist, the instantly effects of hugs which activate inner happiness, along with the <span class="text-info font-weight-bold">fresh air, solar exposure</span> and the womb-like feeling of the boat or the rooting experience of standing on the ground, under trees,
              they all create a powerful, emotional awakening. Passing the river or resting on the grass become a passage ritual to overpass
              the loneliness, gloom and the slumber from our hearts.

            <p class="text-justify">There are moments in time when no present in the world could boost the sense of belonging, of being accepted and appreciated
            for what you are. Hugs are designed for that, as they are simple and pure manifestations of empathy. They make oxytocin,
            the hormone of love, to flow and radiate through your whole body, offering you a beyond words experience that restores your
            emotional balance.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               But as we became more and more confined in our jobs, worries and social norms, we also got uneasy to ask or to offer empathic
              hugs. When someone asks us to hold him or her in our arms, we either offer a short, polite embrace, or we get worried that
              something really unsettling is going on.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
               Hug therapy brings you the bodily experience of empathy, non-judgemental and emotional relieving. Those who experienced
              it felt like literally a stone was moved away from their souls. They satisfied a fundamental need, without going through
              the pain inflicted by the intricate process of managing others’ expectations, believes, emotional disponibility or reactions.
